# Pusher node.js Server library

This is a node.js library for interacting with the Pusher REST API.

Registering at <http://pusher.com> and use the application credentails within your app as shown below.

## Installation
```
$ npm install pusher
```

## How to use

### Constructor

There are 3 ways to configure the client. First one is the most basic:

```javascript
var Pusher = require('pusher');

var pusher = new Pusher({
  appId: 'APP_ID',
  key: 'APP_KEY',
  secret: 'SECRET_KEY',
  scheme: 'SCHEME', // optional, defaults to http
  host: 'HOST', // optional, defaults to api.pusherapp.com
  port: PORT, // optional, defaults to 80 for http and 443 for https
});
```

For specific clusters, you can also use the cluster option:

```javascript
var Pusher = require('pusher');

var pusher = new Pusher({
  appId: 'APP_ID',
  key: 'APP_KEY',
  secret: 'SECRET_KEY',
  scheme: 'SCHEME', // optional, defaults to http
  cluster: 'CLUSTER', // will set the host to `api-CLUSTER.pusher.com`
  port: PORT, // optional, defaults to 80 for http and 443 for https
});
```

You can also specify auth and endpoint options by passing an URL:

```javascript
var Pusher = require('pusher');

var pusher = new Pusher({
  url: "SCHEME://APP_KEY:SECRET_KEY@HOST:PORT/apps/APP_ID"
});
```

This is useful for example on Heroku, which sets the PUSHER_URL environment
variable to such URL, if you have the Pusher addon installed.

#### Additional constructor options

There are 2 additional options: one for HTTP proxy support and one for timeouts:

```javascript
var Pusher = require('pusher');

var pusher = new Pusher({
  // you can set other options in any of the 3 ways described above
  proxy: 'HTTP_PROXY_URL', // optional, URL to proxy the requests through
  timeout: TIMEOUT // optional, timeout for all requests in milliseconds
});
```

### Publishing/Triggering events

To trigger an event on one or more channels use the trigger function.

#### A single channel

```javascript
pusher.trigger('channel-1', 'test_event', { message: "hello world" });
```

#### Multiple channels

```javascript
pusher.trigger([ 'channel-1', 'channel-2' ], 'test_event', { message: "hello world" });
```

### Excluding event recipients

In order to avoid the person that triggered the event also receiving it the `trigger` function can take an optional `socketId` parameter. For more informaiton see: <http://pusher.com/docs/publisher_api_guide/publisher_excluding_recipients>.

```javascript
var socketId = '1302.1081607';

pusher.trigger(channel, event, data, socketId);
```

### Authenticating Private channels

To authorise your users to access private channels on Pusher, you can use the `auth` function:

```javascript
var auth = pusher.auth(socketId, channel);
```

For more information see: <http://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users>

### Authenticating Presence channels

Using presence channels is similar to private channels, but you can specify extra data to identify that particular user:

```javascript
var channelData = {
	user_id: 'unique_user_id',
	user_info: {
	  name: 'Phil Leggetter'
	  twitter_id: '@leggetter'
	}
};
var auth = pusher.auth(socketId, channel, channelData);
```

The `auth` is then returned to the caller as JSON.

For more information see: <http://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users>

### Application State

It's possible to query the state of the application using the `pusher.get` function.
```javascript
pusher.get({ path: path, params: params }, callback);
```
The `path` property identifies the resource that the request should be made to and the `params` property should be a map of additional querystring key and value pairs.

The following example provides the signature of the callback and an example of parsing the result:
```javascript
pusher.get({ path: '/channels', params: {} }, function(error, request, response) {
	if (response.statusCode === 200) {
		var result = JSON.parse(response.body);
		var channelsInfo = result.channels;
	}
});
```

#### Get list of channels in an application
```javascript
pusher.get({ path: '/channels', params: params }, callback);
```

Information on the optional `params` option property and the structure of the returned JSON is defined in the [REST API reference](http://pusher.com/docs/rest_api#method-get-channels).

#### Get single channel state
```javascript
pusher.get({ path: '/channels/[channel_name]', params: params }, callback);
```

Information on the optional `params` option property and the structure of the returned JSON is defined in the [REST API reference](http://pusher.com/docs/rest_api#method-get-channel).

#### Get list of users on a presence channel
```javascript
pusher.get({ path: '/channels/[channel_name]/users' }, callback);
```

The `channel_name` in the path must be a [presence channel](http://pusher.com/docs/presence). The structure of the returned JSON is defined in the [REST API reference](http://pusher.com/docs/rest_api#method-get-users).

## Tests

The tests run using [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/). Make sure
you've got all required modules installed:

    npm install

### Unit tests

You can run unit tests without setting up a Pusher app:

    node_modules/.bin/mocha tests/unit/**/*.js

### Full test suite

In order to run the full test suite, first you need a Pusher app. When starting
mocha, you need to set the PUSHER_URL environment variable to contain your
app credentials, like following:

    `PUSHER_URL='http://KEY:SECRET@api.pusherapp.com/' node_modules/.bin/mocha tests/**/*.js`
